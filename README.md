## Run the tests

Run the test code in `tests_socketio.py` file. Answer the following questions:
* What line of code creates a test client?
* What line of code retrieves the event name of the socket.io emit function?
* What line of code retrieves the data that socket.io sent ?
* What does `self.assertEquals(len(response), 1)` check for?
* What does `self.assertEquals(from_server['name'], "hello to client")` check for?
* If you add `print(response[1])` at the end of the function `test_server_relays_message`, what does it print?
